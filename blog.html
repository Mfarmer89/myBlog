            <h3>About this page</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this blog is for me to practice my web-design skills. I guess we'll find out if I have any written talent. I may turn it into a vessel for positive messages I think the world needs to hear.</p>
            <h3>About me</h3>
            
            <p>This is me. I like to kiteboard, pretend I'm a programmer, watch Netflix in spanish and play on Duolingo for fun. I also like tripping through phases of exercising.. then not, or eating healthy.. then not. I try new sports when I get bored.</p>

                <p>You are a soul-<br>
                And you are given a body to live in.</p>
                <p>Much like your boss giving you tools needed to do a job, God gave you this body to journey through life in. <br>
                Whether or not you take good care of it, is COMPLETELY up to you!</p>
                <p>
                But who the hell are you to criticize it?!?!!  Do not go LOOKING for problems with the gift you have been given! <br>
                <em>“Oh but the thighs...” “my arms..” “if you look closely here..”</em> - <strong>NO!!</strong> <br>It’s a gift! And what a beautiful one it is!! <br>Learn to appreciate it and how much it is capable of! And the fact that you can improve it’s functionality and train it to do new things! 
                </p>
                <p>
                You could even think of it as a rental. You can’t be sure how long you’ll have it, but at some point, you’ll have to give it back. So appreciate it while you have it. Stop criticizing and stop looking for faults. <br> 
                <strong>Love your <u>GIFT!</u></strong>

            <p>I sat on an empty beach one day while my family went for a swim. I saw kites flying, out to sea! Below the kites were people controlling them. They were moving the kites in a way that dragged them up an down the coast, assisting in this technique was a board strapped to their feet. I thought to myself, <em>"that looks pretty cool."</em> Just then, one of the men took flight! The kite lifting him and his board high above the water! <em>"How exhilarating!"</em> I thought. <strong>"This is something I <em>have</em> to try!"</strong> </p>
            <p>Fast forward 15 years, and there I am living out a dream I thought had died. No, I don't yet fly the kites and control the board like those men did. But even accidentally flying through the air is quite the thrill! </p>

            <p>I've started my circus training this year! It's also a great way to fly when the windy season comes to an end. That's right- I've joined the world of aerial sports! Aerial Silks is how we refer to it, known as <u>'telas aeriales'</u> if you are looking for classes in latin america. How is it you ask? Quite different from how it looks. The girls flip and turn with such grace and such neutral expressions on their faces. But man does it not feel that way! I pull myself up the the 'poles' like an angry gorilla, and holler out in pain when that beautiful, delicate material strangles my legs like a boa constrictor going in for the kill! Yes, as always, appearances are quite decieving! <em>Unless of course it's <u>me</u> you're watching!</em></p>
